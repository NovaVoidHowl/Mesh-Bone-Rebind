# NVH's Common Avatar Settings Configuration & Storage System

## Script Overview

This script set is to allow rebinding of meshes to other armatures, note it does not and can not make incompatible armatures and meshes work with each other.  

The primary use case for this is to allow you to add extra items that are made for a given avatar base to it without having to constraint or stack armatures together.  

Note: For it to work the armatures of both the main avatar and the addon (cloths, armor etc.) must sufficiently match one and other, though the addon need not fully have all bones the avatar does.  

Note: This does not work for addons which have extra bones (that the base avatar does not have)
